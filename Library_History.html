    <h2>HISTORY OF THE LIBRARY</h2> 
</header>
<body>
    <h3>Founding</h3>
    <p>The Mead Memorial Library was founded in 2021 in the Columbia Heights neighborhood of Washington, DC. The namesake of the library, Mead the Cat, is the pet of library founder, Jacob Sheldon, and is a local feature in the community.</p>
    <p>Before moving into his current residence in the library, Mead could often be found meowing next to the local Little Free Libraries, encouraging the neighborhood children to take home a free book. So, when it came time to name the neighborhood library, there was no better candidate than the neighborhood's local feline champion for literacy.</p>
